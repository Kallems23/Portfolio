        The pedagogical objective of the eCOM course is project-based learning
        to design, develop, and deploy ergonomic Internet services (e-commerce,
        service exchanges, social networks, etc.) as a team. The service theme
        is renewed each year and is proposed by an external "client" to Polytech
        Grenoble. Technologies cover frontend SPA components, backend, and
        databases. Microservices architecture is advocated. Each team organizes
        development and operations (DevOps) by applying the SCRUM method. The
        MVP of the service is deployed with an IaaS cloud host. Other aspects
        considered include code quality, vulnerability, GDPR compliance,
        resilience, and more

        In this project we want to adapt the interactive Speedscope viewer initially intended for application performance profiles, to visualize traces of task and resource managers, in particular those used in the Evalys project. First, it will be a question of defining a specific format, secondly, it will be a question of adding information dedicated to the interface. Finally, we can also consider the problem of visualizing the activity of a manager in real time.

        Not being fully satisfied with the work done on the team project: Game Engine + Game : Nightmare Monster Attack, I wanted to take on a similar project, this time working independently. More precisely, rebuild the game engine from a completely blank project and not from a project given by the professors.

        The project consists in creating a game engine based on automata and using it to create a game. - ALL game entities have a behavior defined by an automaton - The game parses a file at startup, which indicates the behavior of the game entities, so it's totally customizable. - In particular, your game will feature two player entities controlled by keyboard, mouse or joystick via automata Bots whose behavior is defined by automata - borderless universes (in at least one dimension)        </Typography>
