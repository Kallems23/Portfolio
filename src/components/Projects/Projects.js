        The pedagogical objective of the eCOM course is project-based learning
        to design, develop, and deploy ergonomic Internet services (e-commerce,
        service exchanges, social networks, etc.) as a team. The service theme
        is renewed each year and is proposed by an external "client" to Polytech
        Grenoble. Technologies cover frontend SPA components, backend, and
        databases. Microservices architecture is advocated. Each team organizes
        development and operations (DevOps) by applying the SCRUM method. The
        MVP of the service is deployed with an IaaS cloud host. Other aspects
        considered include code quality, vulnerability, GDPR compliance,
        resilience, and more

        In this project we want to adapt the interactive Speedscope viewer
        initially intended for application performance profiles, to visualize
        traces of task and resource managers, in particular those used in the
        Evalys project. First, it will be a question of defining a specific
        format, secondly, it will be a question of adding information dedicated
        to the interface. Finally, we can also consider the problem of
        visualizing the activity of a manager in real time.

        Not being fully satisfied with the work done on the team project: Game
        Engine + Game : Nightmare Monster Attack, I wanted to take on a similar
        project, this time working independently. More precisely, rebuild the
        game engine from a completely blank project and not from a project given
        by the professors.

        The project consists in creating a game engine based on automata and
        using it to create a game. - ALL game entities have a behavior defined
        by an automaton - The game parses a file at startup, which indicates the
        behavior of the game entities, so it's totally customizable. - In
        particular, your game will feature two player entities controlled by
        keyboard, mouse or joystick via automata Bots whose behavior is defined
        by automata - borderless universes (in at least one dimension)

        The Nuit de lâ€™Info is a national competition that brings together
        students, teachers and companies to work together on the development of
        a web application. The Night takes place every year, from the first
        Thursday of December, sunset, until sunrise the next morning.
        Participants have one night to propose, implement and package a Web 2.0
        application.
